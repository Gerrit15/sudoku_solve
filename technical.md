# Sudoku Solver: Wave Function Collapse
This is a project for solving a given input file of a sudoku board, and then outputting it, using Wave Function Collapse and the Rust language.

## Rustlang
This project will use idomatic Rust, meaning using all the naming conventions and lifetimes typically expected the the compiler. 
Essentially, if `cargo check` doesn't complain, it's idiomatic rust. Rust is a useful language for this project 
because of the `Vec` data structure and it's many multiple associated methods, but more importantly because of its powerful Type system, 
allowing for the wave function collapse to play very nicely with classic `match` patterns in Rust.

## Wave function collapse

## Goals
- Command line input
- Take input files, output files
- Solving the input using wave function collapse

## Stretch Goals
- GUI
